When you need to dive deep into the code, you can easily switch back to the classic IDE.\r\n\r\nCursor 2.0 makes it easy to run many agents in parallel without them interfering with one another, powered by Git worktrees or remote machines. We’ve even found that having multiple models attempt the same problem and picking the best result significantly improves the final output, especially for harder tasks.\r\n\r\n****************\r\nEmbedded browser\r\n****************\r\n\r\nBrowser is now embedded in-editor, including powerful new tools to select elements, full dev tools, and MCP controls for the agent.\r\n\r\n********************\r\nImproved code review\r\n********************\r\n\r\nYou can now also see all of the changes an agent has made across your codebase in a single place instead of jumping across different files.\r\n\r\n********\r\nAnd more\r\n********\r\n\r\n* Voice mode for native speech to text\r\n* Improved language server performance and text rendering throughout the app\r\n* Deeplinks for rules & commands\r\n* Plan mode for Background Agents\r\n* New security controls for Enterprise\r\n\r\nCursor 2.0 is now available for download ( http://cursor.com/download ), and you can read about all changes in our changelog ( https://cursor.com/changelog/2-0 ).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe’re excited to hear what you think!\r\n\r\n- Cursor Team\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe ( https://track.customer.io/unsubscribe/dgT_pwsDANmvyBHYr8gRAZoxj1SX2DO5HRTGsGuYmg== )",

Vellum provides built-in debugging and enterprise-grade monitoring so you see exactly what your agent is doing. Product teams are using Vellum to go from idea to shipped agent in minutes. Use code AIAGENTS25 to get 25% off your first 3 months.\r\nChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini across 10 everyday tasks\r\nHere are my favorite AI models for each task:\r\nEveryday answers (ChatGPT). GPT-5 is fast and concise which makes it great for answering questions. Claude keeps running into rate limits on the $20 / month plan. 😢\r\nWriting and editing (Claude). Claude matches your writing style the best if you give it examples of your writing. ChatGPT likes bullet points too much and Gemini’s writing is too dry and verbose. \r\nCoding (Claude Code and OpenAI Codex). I’m a big fan of Claude Code but many of my friends have switched to OpenAI Codex with GPT-5 high. Codex is slower than Claude but can often fix gnarly bugs in just a few of lines of code. It’s pretty remarkable how fast OpenAI caught up to Anthropic in coding.\r\nWeb search (Gemini). If I need to look up real-time information, Gemini’s AI mode is still much faster than ChatGPT or Claude. That’s also why I still prefer Chrome over OpenAI’s new Atlas browser, chat just takes too long to generate when you want instant results. \r\nDeep research (Claude). I prefer Deep Research from Claude because it creates concise five-page reports that I want to read instead of 30+ pages from ChatGPT or Gemini. Deep Research is truly amazing and I’ll share how I use it later in this post.\r\nVoice (ChatGPT): ChatGPT has the most natural voice and personality but it still interrupts me too much. That’s why I prefer apps like Wispr Flow for AI voice dictation instead of any option from the big labs.\r\nImage (Gemini) and video generation (Sora). Gemini’s Nano Banana is the best image model (watch my tutorial [ https://substack.com/redirect/e65685db-7654-4f6b-a087-4bb9ecb73664?j=eyJ1IjoiMXd6b3oifQ.UbnXFD-cl9vm4e93QpoQQVjYYaWT5B2B9Oq41gvd9K8 ]) and Veo 3.1 is arguably a better video model than Sora. But I love how Sora lets me make videos of my family and friends. OpenAI just gets social better than Google (they hired all the Meta people after all).\r\nLive camera and computer use (none). I don’t find either of these features that useful. Computer use feels especially painful—you’re literally watching the AI click a mouse and take screenshots. It just takes forever. 🫤\r\nLast but not least, let’s talk about Grok. Grok may very well be a great model but I cannot take a product that markets “AI companions” seriously. I think this stuff just turns away people who want to use AI to get serious work done. xAI needs to better marketing.\r\nMy top AI projects for product, creator, and personal work\r\nOk now let’s talk about my go-to AI feature for all three models — Projects. \r\nMaybe I’m old fashioned but I think Projects is far more useful than AI agents, browsers, or whatever is hot in AI right now.\r\nAll 3 big labs have this feature but I prefer Claude Projects because it lets me paste in simple text files directly. \r\n3 tips to get the most out of projects\r\nI create AI projects for everything that I work on. Here’s exactly how I set them up:\r\nAttach Google Workspace files. This ensures that my project always has the latest updates from my Google Docs and other files. I also like to add plain text files and Deep Research outputs as context.\r\nInclude your output style in the prompt. For example, my preferred style is: “Use short bold stems followed by 2-3 short sentences so it’s easy to skim.” This way, AI always writes how I want.\r\nGet AI to iterate on your prompt. After a long chat where AI finally nails the output, I ask: “Can you update the prompt to one shot this?” This way, AI is always helping me improve my project prompt.\r\nNow let’s cover 9 projects that I rely on every day for product, creator, and personal tasks. \r\nMy top 3 projects for product work\r\nEdit product review or PRD docs. I create a  project for every product that I work on and attach my best PRD/strategy doc examples, reference material, and voice dictated notes. Let’s be honest, PMs spend a lot of time editing docs 🥲.  My projects give me both a thought partner and an editor for every product.\r\nDraft performance reviews. I create separate projects for myself and my team. Each project has past performance reviews, leveling expectations, and notes from 1:1s. I use these to iterate on performance reviews, check in on progress, and identify growth areas.\r\nWrite interview summaries. This project has my PM interview guidelines and expectations. After each interview, I use it to convert my rough notes into a structured summary (of course, I still review and edit the notes manually).\r\nMy top 3 projects for creator work\r\nPrep podcast interview guide. This project has my podcast interview template and any reference material on the guest (e.g., transcripts from past interviews). I use it to draft questions and notes that I share with guests ahead of time.\r\nDraft podcast post-production. This project uses my past examples to convert an interview transcript into a list of top quotes, moments to cut, YouTube titles and thumbnails, and even social posts. I’ve spent a lot of time refining the prompt and it alone saves me 3-5 hours a week.\r\nEdit newsletter posts. This project has my best newsletter posts to give it a deep understanding of my writing style. I use it to iterate on my post after I create the first draft.\r\nMy top 3 projects for personal work\r\nGet personal life advice. This project has a Google Doc with my current goals, challenges, and what gives me and drains my energy. It gives me incredible personal advice whenever I feel overwhelmed by life.\r\nPlan weekends and family trips. This project has my family’s interests and travel preferences. I use it to plan weekend trips and longer vacations. It can search online and create personal itineraries that fit my style.\r\nGet home improvement tips. I’m the least handy person out there so I made a project to keep track of what’s broken around the house. It gives me honest advice about what I can DIY vs. need to hire a professional.\r\nI’ve updated my AI Prompt Library with my latest Project prompts\r\nMy AI prompt library now has detailed prompts for the projects above. I’ve added dates so that you can easily find my recently updated prompts. \r\nUpgrade to paid now to get all 24+ prompts and access to my AI community with Colin Matthews.\r\nDeep research: The real “extended thinking” mode\r\nOk now let’s talk about Deep Research.\r\nI think Deep Research is the real extended “thinking mode” for AI. It’s my go-to tool for thinking through a gnarly problem or a difficult decision.\r\n5 steps to get the most out of Deep Research\r\nMost people just type a single question into Deep Research and wonder why the output sucks. Let me show you how to get a much more personalized report in 5 steps:...\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.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.J-M0D60-5CFWK_CbC_3Kg8IGahT257icRjFYj8AdJjE?",

Bubbles can be silly; they also finance railroads. 2025 is the year AI shifted from chatbots to systems that actually do work: agents with tools and memory, wired into governed data, powered by reasoning models. That tension—speculation funding infrastructure—frames everything that follows.\r\n\r\nThe 2025 MAD (Machine Learning, AI & Data) Landscape is our eleventh edition.  This is the biggest redraw in recent memory. We made the editorial decision to substantially cut the logo count—from a peak of 2,000+ last year to ~1,150—to make the map legible and, frankly, possible amid an explosion of new companies and products.\r\n\r\nStructure-wise, we made major edits. We deleted a few sections and added others, for example an explicit agent stack (agent platforms, agents infra/tooling) and local AI. The result is a cleaner flow from data to infra to ML/AI to agents/applications.\r\n\r\nThe 2025 MAD Landscape also includes our roundup of the 25 ideas for 2025: what’s breaking through, what’s consolidating, and where the next wave of value is likely to accrue.\r\n\r\nDig in:\r\n* Blog post — Bubble & Build: The 2025 MAD Landscape (http://mattturck.com/mad2025?utm_source=Public+FirstMark+Newsletter&utm_campaign=cae2fac12f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_07_16_07_31_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_cab2230834-cae2fac12f-157282665)\r\n* PDF (high-res, zoomable) — https://mattturck.com/landscape/mad2025.pdf?utm_source=Public+FirstMark+Newsletter&utm_campaign=cae2fac12f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_07_16_07_31_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_cab2230834-cae2fac12f-157282665\r\n* Website/interactive version (searchable, with data cards) — mad.firstmark.com (http://mad.firstmark.com/?utm_source=Public+FirstMark+Newsletter&utm_campaign=cae2fac12f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_07_16_07_31_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_cab2230834-cae2fac12f-157282665)\r\n\r\nhttps://mad.firstmark.com/?utm_source=Public+FirstMark+Newsletter&utm_campaign=cae2fac12f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_07_16_07_31_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_cab2230834-cae2fac12f-157282665\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nRecent Episodes of the ** MAD Podcast with Matt Turck (https://www.youtube.com/@DataDrivenNYC?utm_source=Public+FirstMark+Newsletter&utm_campaign=cae2fac12f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_07_16_07_31_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_cab2230834-cae2fac12f-157282665)\r\n:\r\n\r\n* ** How GPT-5 Thinks — OpenAI VP of Research Jerry Tworek (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqWIvvv3SnQ&utm_source=Public+FirstMark+Newsletter&utm_campaign=cae2fac12f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_07_16_07_31_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_cab2230834-cae2fac12f-157282665)\r\n* ** Sonnet 4.5 & the AI Plateau Myth — Sholto Douglas of Anthropic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQy4YMYFLsI&utm_source=Public+FirstMark+Newsletter&utm_campaign=cae2fac12f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_07_16_07_31_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_cab2230834-cae2fac12f-157282665)\r\n* ** Are We Misreading the AI Exponential?

You can review and refine the plan before handing it to Cursor to execute.\r\n\r\nWe’ve found that this allows agents to run for significantly longer.\r\n\r\n**************\r\nSlash Commands\r\n**************\r\n\r\nYou can now create reusable prompts and quickly share them with your team. Commands ( https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/commands ) are stored in .cursor/commands/[command].md. Run them by typing /  in the Agent input and selecting the command from the dropdown menu.\r\n\r\nWe’ve been using them for running linters, fixing compile errors, and creating PRs with detailed descriptions and conventional commits.\r\n\r\n****************\r\nBrowser Controls\r\n****************\r\n\r\nAgent can control a web browser ( https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser ) to test applications, audit accessibility, convert designs into code, and more. With full access to console logs and network traffic, Agent can debug issues and automate comprehensive testing workflows.\r\n\r\nStart using with @Browser.\r\n\r\n************************\r\nPR Summaries from Bugbot\r\n************************\r\n\r\nWhen creating a PR in GitHub, Bugbot ( https://cursor.com/bugbot ) will now generate a summary of the changes.

AD Al-Ghourabi, a senior technology leader, said the\r\n>> right answer is to build and buy. \"Buy for parity and build for\r\n>> differentiation,\" he said. \"A lot of AI capabilities and LLMs are now\r\n>> commodities, but anything between your data and a decision is your\r\n>> differentiator and core.\"\r\n>>\r\n>> In recent years, purchasing from a large vendor has offered more\r\n>> predictability over custom-built solutions and best-of-breed alternatives.\r\n>> AI has changed that equation.

The global race for compute capacity requires 300 gigawatts in\r\n>    4.5 years, with power demand doubling every 100 days. Countries need\r\n>    comprehensive digital transformation strategies to remain competitive.\r\n>    - AI is viewed as \"a new industrial base for the United States\" that\r\n>    will determine whether America maintains global leadership or surrenders\r\n>    it. Speakers emphasized that leadership in AI is \"never permanent\" and the\r\n>    pace has gone \"supersonic,\" making this a defense perimeter issue rather\r\n>    than just an economic opportunity.\r\n>    - The fragmented regulatory approach in the US contrasts with the more\r\n>    restrictive *AI Act in Europe*\r\n>    <https://fdrmt-zgph.maillist-manage.com/click/110c473dea1ae0bb9/110c473dea1a9bc94>,\r\n>    which is driving companies to relocate their operations. The need for\r\n>    balanced policies that encourage innovation while providing appropriate\r\n>    guardrails remains a central challenge.\r\n>    - Multiple panelists agreed that AI would affect jobs. These panelists\r\n>    also agreed that no government has an answer for the job losses.\r\n>\r\n> [image:\r\n> https://stratus.campaign-image.com/images/1208218000074314004_zc_v1_1740073473671_screenshot_2025_02_20_at_10.44.07 am.png]\r\n>\r\n> *Pragmatic use cases*\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> David Giambruno, CEO of Nucleaus, has seen his share of technology\r\n> transformations. *We covered Giambruno's approach to cutting IT costs\r\n> last year\r\n> <https://fdrmt-zgph.maillist-manage.com/click/110c473dea1ae0bb9/110c473dea1a9bc96>.\r\n> *\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> To roll out real AI use cases, you'll have to speak to value first, said\r\n> Giambruno, who also said you have to figure out how you're going to build\r\n> and on what platform.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> \"How you build matters both in cost, speed to value, and how much glass\r\n> you want to chew,\" he said.

He also doesn't believe in proofs of concept and\r\n> pilots. Prototypes can be created during the first customer meeting and can\r\n> be rapidly transitioned to production. \"We are using an entirely end-to-end\r\n> AI toolchain,\" said Karkera.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> \"Vibe coding is about 10% to 20% in the prototyping phase. Then it's\r\n> basically deep architecture.

AD Al-Ghourabi, a senior technology leader, said the\r\n> right answer is to build and buy. \"Buy for parity and build for\r\n> differentiation,\" he said. \"A lot of AI capabilities and LLMs are now\r\n> commodities, but anything between your data and a decision is your\r\n> differentiator and core.\"\r\n>\r\n> In recent years, purchasing from a large vendor has offered more\r\n> predictability over custom-built solutions and best-of-breed alternatives.\r\n> AI has changed that equation. You can prototype, test, build, and deliver\r\n> in the time a large tech vendor goes through the procurement cycle.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Others argue that enterprises should buy and push their vendors to\r\n> innovate. There's a huge gap between prototype and production.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Tracey Cesen, Founder & CEO of Forever Human.ai, said the problem with\r\n> building is that \"software is a living, breathing organism, so it requires\r\n> care and feeding.\" That care and feeding also means you continuously\r\n> question whether it should have been built.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Ultimately, the buy vs. build debate boils down to flexibility. Don't get\r\n> caught in an \"ERP data prison,\" one delivery mode that relies on cloud or\r\n> an AI vendor. In the end, enterprise buyers need to take a portfolio\r\n> approach and acquire components that enable them to remain flexible and\r\n> experiment. Also, tier vendors based on approaches and business priorities.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Nicolai Wadstrom, Partner, Co-Head of Ares Venture Capital and AI\r\n> Innovation Groups at Ares Management, said the buy vs. build debate really\r\n> revolves around doing both.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> \"Build vs buy is wrong because you need to build, partner, and buy,\" said\r\n> Wadstrom. \"You want to buy things commoditized. You want to build things\r\n> where you can pour in proprietary knowledge and build a moat. And when you\r\n> need higher skills, you partner.

The reality is that on-premises may drive more returns as\r\n> inference becomes the main AI workload.\r\n>\r\n> \"Don't discard on-premises. A lot of people are doing AI on-premises and\r\n> focused on it,\" said one CxO.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Why you shouldn't discount on-premises AI:\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>    - It's more effective for small models.\r\n>    - Cloud costs can add up.\r\n>    - On-premises AI may make more sense in terms of operations, privacy\r\n>    and security.\r\n>    - Edge use cases are likely to become more of the AI landscape.\r\n>    - There's a continuum of AI deployment models.\r\n>\r\n> *Future of work*\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> The future of work was a topic of hot debate. Most CxOs agreed that\r\n> corporations will use fewer employees and more AI agents and robots. The\r\n> impact on education, income, and society will be significant.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> A few moving parts to ponder:\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>    - New management structures will need to emerge to effectively manage\r\n>    both human and digital workers.\r\n>    - Governments are not currently addressing the impact of AI on jobs,\r\n>    but they will need to do so shortly — within the next 12 to 18 months.\r\n>    - Education will have to evolve, and public institutions aren't\r\n>    prepared. Look for personalized education programs to emerge powered by AI.\r\n>    - Professional training will become more important than university\r\n>    education.\r\n>    - Some attendees noted that humans have always found new roles amid\r\n>    new technology trends.\r\n>    - If AI uplevels the workforce, you’ll see two side effects: First,\r\n>    everyone will move to the median in terms of performance. Second, you’ll\r\n>    have a shortage of experts, as few workers will actually have the 10,000\r\n>    hours required to become an expert.\r\n>\r\n> [image:\r\n> https://stratus.campaign-image.com/images/1208218000074314004_zc_v1_1759421869607_screenshot_2025_10_02_at_10.14.53 am.png]\r\n>\r\n> *Looming questions*\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Between conversations during the panels, a few lingering questions\r\n> remained to ponder. These are worth some rumination.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>    - Have LLMs hit the wall? In a few talks, it was noted that LLMs have\r\n>    already ingested all the publicly available human data. Synthetic data\r\n>    tends to degrade over time as it becomes increasingly distant from the\r\n>    original.\r\n>    - Are we in an AI bubble? We covered this one before, but the worries\r\n>    aren’t going anywhere. See: *Enterprise AI: It's all about the\r\n>    proprietary data*\r\n>    <https://fdrmt-zgph.maillist-manage.com/click/110c473dea1ae0bb9/110c473dea1a9bc9e> |\r\n>    *Watercooler debate: Are we in an AI bubble?*\r\n>    <https://fdrmt-zgph.maillist-manage.com/click/110c473dea1ae0bb9/110c473dea1a9bca0>\r\n>    - Is our brute force compute approach misguided? In the US, the\r\n>    running assumption is that trillions of dollars, data centers the size of\r\n>    Manhattan, and millions of GPUs are the way to get to AI nirvana.

The global race for compute capacity requires 300 gigawatts in\r\n   4.5 years, with power demand doubling every 100 days. Countries need\r\n   comprehensive digital transformation strategies to remain competitive.\r\n   - AI is viewed as \"a new industrial base for the United States\" that\r\n   will determine whether America maintains global leadership or surrenders\r\n   it. Speakers emphasized that leadership in AI is \"never permanent\" and the\r\n   pace has gone \"supersonic,\" making this a defense perimeter issue rather\r\n   than just an economic opportunity.\r\n   - The fragmented regulatory approach in the US contrasts with the more\r\n   restrictive *AI Act in Europe*\r\n   <https://fdrmt-zgph.maillist-manage.com/click/110c473dea1ae0bb9/110c473dea1a9bc94>,\r\n   which is driving companies to relocate their operations. The need for\r\n   balanced policies that encourage innovation while providing appropriate\r\n   guardrails remains a central challenge.\r\n   - Multiple panelists agreed that AI would affect jobs. These panelists\r\n   also agreed that no government has an answer for the job losses.\r\n\r\n[image:\r\nhttps://stratus.campaign-image.com/images/1208218000074314004_zc_v1_1740073473671_screenshot_2025_02_20_at_10.44.07\r\nam.png]\r\n\r\n*Pragmatic use cases*\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Giambruno, CEO of Nucleaus, has seen his share of technology\r\ntransformations. *We covered Giambruno's approach to cutting IT costs last\r\nyear\r\n<https://fdrmt-zgph.maillist-manage.com/click/110c473dea1ae0bb9/110c473dea1a9bc96>.\r\n*\r\n\r\n\r\nTo roll out real AI use cases, you'll have to speak to value first, said\r\nGiambruno, who also said you have to figure out how you're going to build\r\nand on what platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How you build matters both in cost, speed to value, and how much glass you\r\nwant to chew,\" he said. In other words, pick one platform and operating\r\nmodel and run.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce that platform is chosen, provide developers with a safe space to\r\nexperiment and explore what's possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nMukund Gopalan, Global Chief Data Officer at Ingram Micro, said every use\r\ncase for AI needs to have \"a clear line of sight to the top line or bottom\r\nline.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n   - *AI Forum: **For AI agents to work, focus on business outcomes, ROI\r\n   not technology*\r\n   <https://fdrmt-zgph.maillist-manage.com/click/110c473dea1ae0bb9/110c473dea1a9bc98>\r\n\r\nGopalan said every use case is different, but the guiding principle is that\r\nthey need to save costs, drive revenue, or save time.\r\n\r\n\r\nScott Gnau, Vice President of Data Platforms at Intersystems, cited a use\r\ncase that achieved all three goals with ambient listening AI that\r\nintegrated into the workflow of electronic health records. \"A physician\r\ncould have a conversation, look a patient in the eye, and have everything\r\ncaptured and get a list of recommendations from an AI agent,\" said Gnau.\r\n\"This use case takes an existing process and makes it fully optimized yet\r\nhuman.\"\r\n\r\n[image:\r\nhttps://stratus.campaign-image.com/images/1208218000074314004_zc_v1_1757525597394_screenshot_2025_09_10_at_10.08.34\r\nam.png]\r\n\r\nUse cases that turned up on a panel:\r\n\r\n\r\n   - Data cleansing and finding out where sensitive data resides.\r\n   - Data engineering.\r\n   - Pull logic out of stored procedures.\r\n   - Transforming legacy applications with AI.\r\n   - Knowledge management applications.\r\n\r\nNilanjan Sengupta, SVP / Industry Market Director, Public Sector and\r\nHealthcare, Americas at Thoughtworks, said the software development\r\nlifecycle is a clear use case for AI agents. \"The main trend we're seeing\r\nis legacy modernization across the entire enterprise,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnand Iyer, Chief AI Officer at Welldoc, said his company has developed a\r\nlarge sensor model that utilizes sensor data to predict glucose values in\r\nthe hours ahead. \"When we think about where healthcare is headed, a lot of\r\nus are trying to get to the prevention piece,\" said Iyer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Danenberg, a senior software engineer at Google's DeepMind and the\r\nlead of rapid prototyping for Gemini, said enterprises have been expanding\r\nthe use case roster. Danenberg said that there has been a shift in\r\ncompanies regarding how they use foundational models, from reluctance to\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompanies are focusing on low-hanging fruit for use cases, but these add\r\nup. \"Anything where you need to extract structured data from unstructured\r\ndata is beautiful low-hanging fruit you can get started with,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n   - *AI Forum: **Google DeepMind’s Danenberg on emerging LLM trends to\r\n   watch*\r\n   <https://fdrmt-zgph.maillist-manage.com/click/110c473dea1ae0bb9/110c473dea1a9bc9a>\r\n\r\n\r\n*Proofs of concepts are panned widely*\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there was a punching bag at the AI Forum in Washington, DC, it was the\r\nproof of concept.\r\n\r\n\r\nCxOs repeatedly panned POCs because they were an excuse for not doing the\r\nwork upfront, sucking in funds, and creating rabbit holes. \"Before you get\r\nto the POC, we often trip over ourselves with understanding our data,\" said\r\none federal government AI leader. \"Rather than doing POCs, do a discovery\r\nsprint for AI, and it will quickly unveil where the holes in your data are.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSunil Karkera, Founder of Soul of the Machine, is leveraging agentic AI to\r\noutpace much larger companies. \"We solve boring problems and it's\r\nexciting,\" said Karkera. He also doesn't believe in proofs of concept and\r\npilots. Prototypes can be created during the first customer meeting and can\r\nbe rapidly transitioned to production. \"We are using an entirely end-to-end\r\nAI toolchain,\" said Karkera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Vibe coding is about 10% to 20% in the prototyping phase. Then it's\r\nbasically deep architecture. Engineering AI is really hard because most of\r\nthe work is context engineering, and it's not straightforward.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n   - *AI Forum: **Soul of the Machine: AI proof of concepts a waste of time*\r\n   <https://fdrmt-zgph.maillist-manage.com/click/110c473dea1ae0bb9/110c473dea1a9bc9c>\r\n\r\n\r\n*Are chief AI officers a thing?*\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a room with a few chief AI officers and ask them whether there's\r\nstaying power in their titles and you're likely to get some interesting\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe takeaways from a panel:\r\n\r\n\r\n   - The chief AI officer role is needed now, but will be structured into\r\n   the organization.\r\n   - CAIOs revolve around a centralized approach, but they will likely\r\n   disappear once AI is decentralized across an organization.\r\n   - CIOs will need to work with CAIOs for the foreseeable future on\r\n   frameworks, tools, platforms, and governance.\r\n   - Enterprises with CAIOs must strike a balance between business acumen\r\n   and technical proficiency.\r\n   - It's not a vanity title...yet.\r\n\r\n*Build vs. Buy*\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it came to building AI applications, CxOs at the AI Forum were split\r\non build vs. buy. AD Al-Ghourabi, a senior technology leader, said the\r\nright answer is to build and buy. \"Buy for parity and build for\r\ndifferentiation,\" he said. \"A lot of AI capabilities and LLMs are now\r\ncommodities, but anything between your data and a decision is your\r\ndifferentiator and core.\"\r\n\r\nIn recent years, purchasing from a large vendor has offered more\r\npredictability over custom-built solutions and best-of-breed alternatives.\r\nAI has changed that equation. You can prototype, test, build, and deliver\r\nin the time a large tech vendor goes through the procurement cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\nOthers argue that enterprises should buy and push their vendors to\r\ninnovate. There's a huge gap between prototype and production.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracey Cesen, Founder & CEO of Forever Human.ai, said the problem with\r\nbuilding is that \"software is a living, breathing organism, so it requires\r\ncare and feeding.\" That care and feeding also means you continuously\r\nquestion whether it should have been built.\r\n\r\n\r\nUltimately, the buy vs. build debate boils down to flexibility. Don't get\r\ncaught in an \"ERP data prison,\" one delivery mode that relies on cloud or\r\nan AI vendor. In the end, enterprise buyers need to take a portfolio\r\napproach and acquire components that enable them to remain flexible and\r\nexperiment. Also, tier vendors based on approaches and business priorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nNicolai Wadstrom, Partner, Co-Head of Ares Venture Capital and AI\r\nInnovation Groups at Ares Management, said the buy vs. build debate really\r\nrevolves around doing both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Build vs buy is wrong because you need to build, partner, and buy,\" said\r\nWadstrom. \"You want to buy things commoditized. You want to build things\r\nwhere you can pour in proprietary knowledge and build a moat. And when you\r\nneed higher skills, you partner. The complacent thinking of a traditional\r\nCIO approach, where I buy someone else's technology roadmap, is over. You\r\nwon't be competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderstand the drivers and competitors, define your problem, opportunity\r\nlandscape and drive a technology roadmap.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n*On-premises still matters*\r\n\r\n\r\nCxOs noted that the conversation around AI often assumes the use of cloud\r\ncomputing. The reality is that on-premises may drive more returns as\r\ninference becomes the main AI workload.\r\n\r\n\"Don't discard on-premises. A lot of people are doing AI on-premises and\r\nfocused on it,\" said one CxO.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy you shouldn't discount on-premises AI:\r\n\r\n\r\n   - It's more effective for small models.\r\n   - Cloud costs can add up.\r\n   - On-premises AI may make more sense in terms of operations, privacy and\r\n   security.\r\n   - Edge use cases are likely to become more of the AI landscape.\r\n   - There's a continuum of AI deployment models.\r\n\r\n*Future of work*\r\n\r\n\r\nThe future of work was a topic of hot debate. Most CxOs agreed that\r\ncorporations will use fewer employees and more AI agents and robots. The\r\nimpact on education, income, and society will be significant.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few moving parts to ponder:\r\n\r\n\r\n   - New management structures will need to emerge to effectively manage\r\n   both human and digital workers.\r\n   - Governments are not currently addressing the impact of AI on jobs, but\r\n   they will need to do so shortly — within the next 12 to 18 months.\r\n   - Education will have to evolve, and public institutions aren't\r\n   prepared. Look for personalized education programs to emerge powered by AI.\r\n   - Professional training will become more important than university\r\n   education.\r\n   - Some attendees noted that humans have always found new roles amid new\r\n   technology trends.\r\n   - If AI uplevels the workforce, you’ll see two side effects: First,\r\n   everyone will move to the median in terms of performance. Second, you’ll\r\n   have a shortage of experts, as few workers will actually have the 10,000\r\n   hours required to become an expert.\r\n\r\n[image:\r\nhttps://stratus.campaign-image.com/images/1208218000074314004_zc_v1_1759421869607_screenshot_2025_10_02_at_10.14.53\r\nam.png]\r\n\r\n*Looming questions*\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween conversations during the panels, a few lingering questions remained\r\nto ponder. These are worth some rumination.\r\n\r\n\r\n   - Have LLMs hit the wall? In a few talks, it was noted that LLMs have\r\n   already ingested all the publicly available human data. Synthetic data\r\n   tends to degrade over time as it becomes increasingly distant from the\r\n   original.\r\n   - Are we in an AI bubble? We covered this one before, but the worries\r\n   aren’t going anywhere. See: *Enterprise AI: It's all about the\r\n   proprietary data*\r\n   <https://fdrmt-zgph.maillist-manage.com/click/110c473dea1ae0bb9/110c473dea1a9bc9e>\r\n|\r\n   *Watercooler debate: Are we in an AI bubble?*\r\n   <https://fdrmt-zgph.maillist-manage.com/click/110c473dea1ae0bb9/110c473dea1a9bca0>\r\n   - Is our brute force compute approach misguided? In the US, the running\r\n   assumption is that trillions of dollars, data centers the size of\r\n   Manhattan, and millions of GPUs are the way to get to AI nirvana. However,\r\n   there must be more elegant engineering and innovation available. Are we\r\n   mired in AI factory groupthink?\r\n\r\n[image:\r\nhttps://stratus.campaign-image.com/images/1208218000074314004_zc_v1_1759421880369_screenshot_2025_10_02_at_10.14.59\r\nam.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n*From our underwriters:*\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Cohere has secured an additional $100 million from investors as part of\r\n   a second close to its latest funding round. *The company's valuation is\r\n   now about $7 billion*\r\n   <https://fdrmt-zgph.maillist-manage.com/click/110c473dea1ae0bb9/110c473dea1a9bca2>\r\n   .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*NOTEBOOK*\r\n\r\n↔️ *UiPath expanded its UiPath Platform*\r\n<https://fdrmt-zgph.maillist-manage.com/click/110c473dea1ae0bb9/110c473dea1a9bca4>,\r\nwhich is designed for agentic AI automation and orchestration, and\r\npartnered with a variety of companies, including OpenAI, Google, Microsoft,\r\nNvidia, and Snowflake, as it solidified its integration strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n👋 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella handed marketing and operations to Judson\r\nAlthoff, naming him CEO of Microsoft's commercial business.

Countries need comprehensive digital\r\ntransformation strategies to remain competitive.\r\n* AI is viewed as \"a new industrial base for\r\nthe United States\" that will determine whether America maintains global\r\nleadership or surrenders it. Speakers emphasized that leadership in AI is\r\n\"never permanent\" and the pace has gone \"supersonic,\"\r\nmaking this a defense perimeter issue rather than just an economic opportunity.\r\n* The fragmented regulatory approach in the US\r\ncontrasts with the more restrictive https://artificialintelligenceact.eu AI Act in Europe , which is driving companies to relocate their operations. The need for balanced policies that encourage\r\ninnovation while providing appropriate guardrails remains a central challenge.\r\n* Multiple panelists agreed that AI would affect\r\njobs. These panelists also agreed that no government has an answer for the job\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\nPragmatic use cases\r\n\r\nDavid Giambruno, CEO of Nucleaus, has seen his share of\r\ntechnology transformations. https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/how-burn-down-your-legacy-it-10-not-so-easy-steps We\r\ncovered Giambruno's approach to cutting IT costs last year .\r\n\r\nTo roll out real AI use cases, you'll have to speak to value\r\nfirst, said Giambruno, who also said you have to figure out how you're going to\r\nbuild and on what platform.\r\n\r\n\"How you build matters both in cost, speed to value,\r\nand how much glass you want to chew,\" he said. In other words, pick one\r\nplatform and operating model and run.\r\n\r\nOnce that platform is chosen, provide developers with a safe space to experiment and explore what's possible.\r\n\r\nMukund Gopalan, Global Chief Data Officer at Ingram Micro,\r\nsaid every use case for AI needs to have \"a clear line of sight to the top\r\nline or bottom line.\"\r\n* AI\r\nForum: https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/ai-agents-work-focus-business-outcomes-roi-not-technology For\r\nAI agents to work, focus on business outcomes, ROI not technology\r\nGopalan said every use case is different, but the guiding\r\nprinciple is that they need to save costs, drive revenue, or save time.\r\n\r\nScott Gnau, Vice President of Data Platforms at\r\nIntersystems, cited a use case that achieved all three goals with ambient listening AI that integrated into the workflow of electronic health records. \"A physician\r\ncould have a conversation, look a patient in the eye, and have everything\r\ncaptured and get a list of recommendations from an AI agent,\" said Gnau.\r\n\"This use case takes an existing process and makes it fully optimized yet\r\nhuman.\"\r\n\r\nUse cases that turned up on a panel:\r\n* Data cleansing and finding out where sensitive\r\ndata resides.\r\n* Data engineering.\r\n* Pull logic out of stored procedures.\r\n* Transforming legacy applications with AI.\r\n* Knowledge management applications.\r\nNilanjan Sengupta, SVP / Industry Market Director, Public\r\nSector and Healthcare, Americas at Thoughtworks, said the software development\r\nlifecycle is a clear use case for AI agents. \"The main trend we're seeing\r\nis legacy modernization across the entire enterprise,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAnand Iyer, Chief AI Officer at Welldoc, said his company\r\nhas developed a large sensor model that utilizes sensor data to predict\r\nglucose values in the hours ahead. \"When we think about where healthcare\r\nis headed, a lot of us are trying to get to the prevention piece,\" said\r\nIyer.\r\n\r\nPeter Danenberg, a senior software engineer at Google's\r\nDeepMind and the lead of rapid prototyping for Gemini, said enterprises have been\r\nexpanding the use case roster. Danenberg said that there has been a shift in\r\ncompanies regarding how they use foundational models, from reluctance to\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nCompanies are focusing on low-hanging fruit for use cases, but these\r\nadd up. \"Anything where you need to extract structured data from\r\nunstructured data is beautiful low-hanging fruit you can get started\r\nwith,\" he said.\r\n* AI\r\nForum: https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/google-deepmind-s-danenberg-emerging-llm-trends-watch Google\r\nDeepMind’s Danenberg on emerging LLM trends to watc h\r\n\r\nProofs of concepts are panned widely\r\n\r\nIf there was a punching bag at the AI Forum in Washington, DC, it was the proof of concept.\r\n\r\nCxOs repeatedly panned POCs because they were an excuse for\r\nnot doing the work upfront, sucking in funds, and creating rabbit holes.\r\n\"Before you get to the POC, we often trip over ourselves with understanding\r\nour data,\" said one federal government AI leader. \"Rather than doing\r\nPOCs, do a discovery sprint for AI, and it will quickly unveil where the holes\r\nin your data are.\"\r\n\r\nSunil Karkera, Founder of Soul of the Machine, is leveraging\r\nagentic AI to outpace much larger companies. \"We solve boring problems and\r\nit's exciting,\" said Karkera. He also doesn't believe in proofs of\r\nconcept and pilots. Prototypes can be created during the first customer meeting and can be rapidly transitioned to production. \"We are using an entirely end-to-end AI\r\ntoolchain,\" said Karkera.\r\n\r\n\"Vibe coding is about 10% to 20% in the\r\nprototyping phase. Then it's basically deep architecture. Engineering AI is\r\nreally hard because most of the work is context engineering, and it's not\r\nstraightforward.\"\r\n* AI\r\nForum: https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/soul-machine-ai-proof-concepts-waste-time Soul\r\nof the Machine: AI proof of concepts a waste of time\r\n\r\nAre chief AI officers a thing?\r\n\r\nTake a room with a few chief AI officers and ask them\r\nwhether there's staying power in their titles and you're likely to get some\r\ninteresting answers.\r\n\r\nThe takeaways from a panel:\r\n* The chief AI officer role is needed now, but will\r\nbe structured into the organization.\r\n* CAIOs revolve around a centralized approach, but they will likely disappear once AI is decentralized across an organization.\r\n* CIOs will need to work with CAIOs for the\r\nforeseeable future on frameworks, tools, platforms, and governance.\r\n* Enterprises with CAIOs must strike a balance between business\r\nacumen and technical proficiency.\r\n* It's not a vanity title...yet.\r\nBuild vs. Buy\r\n\r\nWhen it came to building AI applications, CxOs at the AI\r\nForum were split on build vs. buy. AD Al-Ghourabi, a senior technology leader,\r\nsaid the right answer is to build and buy. \"Buy for parity and build for\r\ndifferentiation,\" he said. \"A lot of AI capabilities and LLMs are now\r\ncommodities, but anything between your data and a decision is your\r\ndifferentiator and core.\"\r\n\r\nIn recent years, purchasing from a large vendor has offered more predictability over custom-built solutions and best-of-breed alternatives. AI has changed that equation. You\r\ncan prototype, test, build, and deliver in the time a large tech vendor goes\r\nthrough the procurement cycle.\r\n\r\nOthers argue that enterprises should buy and push their\r\nvendors to innovate. There's a huge gap between prototype and production.\r\n\r\nTracey Cesen, Founder & CEO of Forever Human.ai, said\r\nthe problem with building is that \"software is a living, breathing\r\norganism, so it requires care and feeding.\" That care and feeding also\r\nmeans you continuously question whether it should have been built.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the buy vs. build debate boils down to\r\nflexibility. Don't get caught in an \"ERP data prison,\" one delivery\r\nmode that relies on cloud or an AI vendor. In the end, enterprise buyers need to take a\r\nportfolio approach and acquire components that enable them to remain flexible and\r\nexperiment. Also, tier vendors based on approaches and business priorities.\r\n\r\nNicolai Wadstrom, Partner, Co-Head of Ares Venture Capital\r\nand AI Innovation Groups at Ares Management, said the buy vs. build debate\r\nreally revolves around doing both.\r\n\r\n\"Build vs buy is wrong because you need to build,\r\npartner, and buy,\" said Wadstrom. \"You want to buy things\r\ncommoditized. You want to build things where you can pour in proprietary knowledge\r\nand build a moat. And when you need higher skills, you partner. The complacent thinking of a traditional CIO approach, where I buy someone else's technology roadmap, is over. You won't be competitive.\r\n\r\nUnderstand the drivers and\r\ncompetitors, define your problem, opportunity landscape and drive a technology\r\nroadmap.\"\r\n\r\nOn-premises still matters\r\n\r\nCxOs noted that the conversation around AI often assumes the use of cloud computing. The reality is that on-premises may drive more\r\nreturns as inference becomes the main AI workload.\r\n\"Don't discard on-premises. A lot of people are doing\r\nAI on-premises and focused on it,\" said one CxO.\r\n\r\nWhy you shouldn't discount on-premises AI:\r\n* It's more effective for small models.\r\n* Cloud costs can add up.\r\n* On-premises AI may make more sense in terms of\r\noperations, privacy and security.\r\n* Edge use cases are likely to become more of the\r\nAI landscape.\r\n* There's a continuum of AI deployment models.\r\nFuture of work\r\n\r\nThe future of work was a topic of hot debate. Most CxOs agreed that\r\ncorporations will use fewer employees and more AI agents and robots. The impact\r\non education, income, and society will be significant.\r\n\r\nA few moving parts to ponder:\r\n* New management structures will need to emerge to effectively manage both human and digital workers.\r\n* Governments are not currently addressing the impact of AI on jobs, but they will need to do so shortly — within the next 12 to 18 months.\r\n* Education will have to evolve, and public\r\ninstitutions aren't prepared. Look for personalized education programs to\r\nemerge powered by AI.\r\n* Professional training will become more important\r\nthan university education.\r\n* Some attendees noted that humans have always\r\nfound new roles amid new technology trends.\r\n* If AI uplevels the workforce, you’ll see two side\r\neffects: First, everyone will move to the median in terms of performance.\r\nSecond, you’ll have a shortage of experts, as few workers will actually have the 10,000 hours required to become an expert.\r\n\r\nLooming questions\r\n\r\nBetween conversations during the panels, a few lingering questions remained to ponder. These are worth some rumination.\r\n* Have LLMs hit the wall? In a few talks, it was\r\nnoted that LLMs have already ingested all the publicly available human data. Synthetic data tends to degrade over time as it becomes increasingly distant from the original.\r\n* Are we in an AI bubble? We covered this one\r\nbefore, but the worries aren’t going anywhere.

Are\r\nwe mired in AI factory groupthink?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n>From our underwriters:\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nCohere has secured an additional $100 million from investors\r\nas part of a second close to its latest funding round. https://cohere.com/blog/september-2025-funding-round The company's\r\nvaluation is now about $7 billion .\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNOTEBOOK\r\n\r\n↔️ https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/uipath-adds-agentic-ai-features-automation-platform-expands-partnerships UiPath expanded its UiPath Platform , which is designed for agentic AI automation and orchestration, and partnered with a variety of companies, including OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Snowflake, as it solidified its integration strategy.\r\n\r\n👋 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella handed marketing and\r\noperations to Judson Althoff, naming him CEO of Microsoft's commercial\r\nbusiness.

Work with AI to write a prompt to build the website\r\nNow let’s ask ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini to create an AI prompt to build the website. I’ve included my full prompt below for your convenience. Just replace the bold section:\r\nBuild a high-end, cinematic travel catalog website with beautiful fonts. The site must use a full-screen vertical scroll-snap layout where every section is 100vh.\r\nStructure & Content:\r\n1. Landing Section:\r\nBackground video: Cinematic slow-motion waves crashing on a dark sand beach at sunset, moody and atmospheric.\r\nLayout: Split screen or heavy typography focus.\r\nHeadline: “My top 5 favorite countries” in massive, tracking-tight white typography (Inter or Helvetica).\r\nInteractive List: A numbered list (01-05) of destinations below. Hovering a destination shifts the text right and reveals an arrow. Clicking smoothly scrolls to that section.\r\n2. Destination Sections:\r\nEach section must have a unique full-screen background video, centered white text with a dark overlay for readability, and entrance animations (fade up). You should use AI to generate the videos based on the descriptions below.\r\nJapan: Slow zoom on Himeji Castle framed by drifting cherry blossoms\r\nPortugal: Golden hour drone glide over Lisbon’s terracotta rooftops\r\nItaly: Positano’s pastel homes cascading to sea in golden hour light\r\nSpain: Slow dolly through the Alhambra’s intricate Moorish archways\r\nFrance: Cinematic reveal of Eze village perched over the Mediterranean\r\nTech stack and style:\r\nReact + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion.\r\nUse scroll-snap-type: y mandatory for the container.\r\nTypography: Clean sans-serif (Inter), white text on dark backgrounds.\r\nVideos: Use high-quality, muted, autoplaying loops for all sections.\r\n3. Paste the prompt into Replit Design Mode to build\r\nNow go to Replit, select Design Mode, and paste in your prompt. The whole process takes about 2 minutes. Grab a coffee while it generates your site. \r\nSometimes, the prompt above generates static images instead of videos. If that happens, just ask it nicely: “No, I want full looping videos for each background.” If you want to edit copy, just be specific about what you want changed. \r\nThere’s no need to read or touch code in any part of this process 🙂\r\nWhen you’re finished, hit Publish on the top right to take your site live. It’s that simple, and the design is night and day from the typical purple AI slop.\r\n10 beautiful websites and apps to build next\r\nI spent a few hours on the weekend finding the best websites and apps that people have created with Replit and Gemini 3. Below, I’ve included all the actual prompts and instructions to make it easy for you to build and personalize these yourself.\r\nRemember that you can get Replit Core for free to try these prompts by upgrading to my annual plan.

It looks a bit too much like a crypto site to me, but maybe you’ll like it.\r\nCreate a portfolio site for a creative director at a gaming studio. Aesthetic: cyberpunk command center meets sleek product design. Hero section with real-time particle system that reacts to mouse movement. Case studies designed like unlocking game levels with progress bars and video trailers that expand on click. Use dark purple and electric blue color scheme with neon accents.\r\n7. An audio product page with buttery smooth parallax (link [ https://substack.com/redirect/ba6312d3-9500-4b61-86f6-1c654a08d2fe?j=eyJ1IjoiMXd6b3oifQ.UbnXFD-cl9vm4e93QpoQQVjYYaWT5B2B9Oq41gvd9K8 ])\r\nThis prompt creates a minimalist product page with smooth parallax scrolling and moody product videos.\r\nBuild a product page for a high-end audio hardware company.

Design: High-end editorial, white serif text, dark gradients. Copy highlights: Dream, Reality ($3.2M fixer starter home), Schools (insanely pricy private schools), Commute (90 min to drive 12 miles), Opportunity (bidding war). Add smooth scroll animations.\r\nThe holidays are a perfect time to build\r\nIf you ever get tired of talking to your relatives, here’s what I recommend:\r\nDownload Replit Mobile [ https://substack.com/redirect/9a9e3522-489e-43e0-bb07-84375e28cc08?j=eyJ1IjoiMXd6b3oifQ.UbnXFD-cl9vm4e93QpoQQVjYYaWT5B2B9Oq41gvd9K8 ]\r\nGet 3 months free by upgrading to my annual plan [ https://substack.com/redirect/88058548-a0a7-47c3-aa0f-1e78a6d93b0a?j=eyJ1IjoiMXd6b3oifQ.UbnXFD-cl9vm4e93QpoQQVjYYaWT5B2B9Oq41gvd9K8 ] (offer expires in 5 days)\r\nCopy one of my prompts above into Replit and watch the magic 🙂\r\nTo be honest, I built some of the websites above while waiting in line for boba tea.

I’m excited for a future where agents do all of our busy work.\r\nTop 10 takeaways I learned from this episode\r\nEvery real SaaS app needs 6 core integrations. Unlike prototypes, real apps are full stack and typically include authentication (Google, GitHub), payment (Stripe),  email (SendGrid), file storage, analytics (PostHog), and error logging (Sentry). Without these, you can’t easily onboard users, collect money, or identify bugs.\r\nStart with production-ready templates instead of building from scratch. SaaS templates (e.g., from Vercel [ https://substack.com/redirect/f5be3066-f831-47ab-a522-a1b7d3408953?j=eyJ1IjoiMXd6b3oifQ.UbnXFD-cl9vm4e93QpoQQVjYYaWT5B2B9Oq41gvd9K8 ]) come with auth, payments, and databases already built-in. Starting your SaaS app with these templates is much easier than trying to get AI to build from scratch.\r\nVibe coded apps have obvious mistakes if you look closely. For example, ...\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.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.zzNYfFnM0TOkwQ6uz2ulrKpP0C19hCIjWSIMHzRJopc?",
